# African-language-Speech-Recognition---Speech-to-Text


The design of this intelligent form requires selected people to install an app on their mobile phone, and whenever they buy food, 
they use their voice to activate the app to register the list of items they just bought in their own language.
The intelligent systems in the app are expected to live to transcribe the speech-to-text and organize the information in an easy-to-process way in a database.
